# A Rate-Distortion View of Human Pragmatic Reasoning

Implementation of the RD-RSA model of pragmatic reasoning (Zaslavsky et al., 2020; 2021). For comparison and evaluation, this repo also includes an implementation of the original RSA model (Frank and Goodman, 2012).

### Environment setup

- Install required packages
  ```bash 
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Add the `src` directory to the project's path

### Demo

Run `scripts/demo.py` for a demo showing how to run the models and display their solutions.
